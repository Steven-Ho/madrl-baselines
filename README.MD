# Multi-agent algorithms
## Environments
Based on Multiagent Particle Envs, which includes both cooperative and competitive scenarios. All of them have continuous state space and action space.
## Algorithms
* MADDPG
* QMIX
## Settings
The implementations in this projects focus on continuous action/state space. However, the Multiagent Particle Envs take discrete action space as default. Before testing these algorithms, you must set MPE to continuous version.
